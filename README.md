<h2>This project is a counter that increases and decreases according to the button you press</h2>

<h3>We have used some languages ​​in this small project such as</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Html</li>
  <li>Css</li>

</ul>

<p>At the beginning of the project, we used html to build the structure of the project</p>
<p>Then we used css to format the project and make some effects such as the background color of the project and the centering of the counter</p>
<p>After that, we used javascript language to add interactivity to the project</p>
